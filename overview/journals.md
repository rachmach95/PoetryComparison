Here is a list of each journal entry along with the date on which they are due on Slack.

## Journal Entry 1 – 09.06.2017

How does Slack compare to the Memex? More generally, how does your experience of computers compare with what Vannevar Bush is talking about? Do you think Bush helps us think about digital writing?

### Part II: Apply

Where else do you see yourself using Slack? Has it or Bush's essay changed the way you think about writing on a computer? What have you learned to do cool on Slack that we haven't talked about yet?

## Journal Entry 2 – 09.13.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Are all texts multimodal? What if I told you they were. Would you believe me? Why or why not? Given that this syllabus is mostly a block of text written in a style roughly corresponding to a technical document, how would you describe it's multimodality? How would an essay be multimodal? If everything is multimodal, why is "multimodal" a useful concept?

### Part II: Apply

Find a Twitter or Tumblr account you enjoy. Use the five modes to analyze how that user is making arguments about who they are as a person. Include a link to the account in question in your journal entry. You may also write about Slack, if you prefer.

## Journal Entry 3 – 09.20.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Do Lanham and Manovich's optimism about the ability for computerized writing to reshape and extend learning, inquiry, and creativity seem born out now that we are reading this years later? Why or why not? Where do you think this optimism comes from? Is there any new technology today that you see people being similarly excited about?

### Part II: Apply

Thinking about Manovich and Lanham, what kinds of texts could you imagine making with the affordances of the computer? What do Manovich and Lanham leave out?

## Journal Entry 4 – 09.27.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Are video games art? Are they writing? Why or why not? Use the texts we have been discussing in this unit in your discussion as evidence in your argument.

### Part II: Apply

What is a video game you have encountered that seems to make a particular argument? If you have a favorite game that you think does not make an argument, can you consider it more in depth and analyze its argument?

## Journal Entry 5 – 10.04.2017

### Part I: Reflect

Do you find that collaborative writing does or might imply different strategies for writing? If so, what do you do to manage collaborative writing? If not, why not?

Now that we have studied several different digital technologies, which do you prefer and why? Do you find that this preference is due to having a specific final project in mind? Or because you think in a particular way?

### Part II: Apply

What kind of argument do you want to make with your final project? What kinds of technologies will you use to do this?
