## Participation

Participation involves showing up for class but it also involves more than that. To get full credit for participation, you can throughout the semester:

* Ask a substantive question in class
* Ask the same question on `#01-discussion` on [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com) during class.
* Drop by office hours to get help or talk over an issue.
* Take detailed notes in class and share them on [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com).

## Journal

During class, you will keep a weekly journal in which you reflect on course discussion and apply what you have learned.

Journals are due on Wednesdays and you post them to our [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com).

Each week's Readme.md file contains a journal prompt that asks you to reflect and apply the lessons discussed in class during the week. Your response to the prompt should be shared with me on Slack by the following Wednesday.

### Learning Outcomes

This assignment is meant to teach you how to:

* Document your understanding of course goals by concreate reflection.
* Identify key concepts from our reading & course discussion.
* Apply these key concepts to real world examples of digital authoring.

### How To Journal on Slack

1. Find the "Direct Messages" section of the sidebar on Slack. It will list all the users in our course. One link will be to your username (it will also have " (you)" after the name to make sure you know that it is your account). Click on your name.
1. You are now [direct message with yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU). Click the "+" next to the post box (where it says "Jot something down"). This will open a new post window.
1. Title the post with your name and the week of the class (1, 2, 3). So, for instance, my title for week 3 would be "Andrew Pilsch Week 3 Journal".
1. You can write your journal entry in the editor. Once we learn [Markdown](../units/02-tools/06-markdown), you can use Markdown in the editor. The post will automatically save.
	* If you close the editor without finishing your post, you can get back to it by visiting [https://engl460.slack.com/files](https://engl460.slack.com/files) and click on "My Files" to see the list of posts.
1. At this point, the post will be private. Hit the green "Share" button in the upper right of the post editor. In the "Share with" dropdown, either select me "apilsch" or type "apilsch" to find me. Click "Share" to let me know you are done with your journal. I cannot give you credit for your journal entries until you share them with me.
1. **(optional)** You may also share your journal entries to the `03-journals` channel to invite your classmates to read and comment on your posts.

## Final Project

For the final project, you will work in groups to produce a digital artifact that uses the theories of digital text we discussed in the [theory section](../units/01-theory) and/or the technologies we discused in the [tools section](../units/02-tools) (as well as others you identify with your group and with my help). Your artifact must respond to a particular rhetorical situation and *make an argument* in some way (this argument can be about the nature of digital texts or it can be about anything else).

The final project will be evaluated less on how polished your final artifact is and more on how thoroughly your group completes the scaffolding components and, most importantly, *how well your final artifact makes the argument you planned to make*.

As to the specific genre or modes you use, this decision will be up to your group, though in learning [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Twine](https://twinery.org/), and [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), we have learned about three tools that could be used to create projects. You may also make a video or investigate another genre or problem space in which you would like to intervene.

### Learning Outcomes

This assignment is meant to teach you how to:

* Formulate an argument that can be made using a digital text.
* Work as a team to produce a persuasive digital text.
* Plan and organize a team-driven project.
* Use project management software to track and organize progress.
* Design a digital text as a mockup and produce a final text from mockups.

### Components

There are four required and one optional component to the final project. Three of the required components and the optional component are to be completed and turned in as a group. The final component, [the Group Work Report](#group-work-report), will be turned in individually.

#### Proposal

The first step for creating your final project artifact will be to propose your project. A proposal is a formal statement of intent that is a standard way of inaugurating and outlining a new project, though it is increasingly being replaced in business with the less formal pitch presentation.

Your group's proposal will have the following elements:

* **Overview**: What are you making? How will you make it? What will be the genre of the artifact? What argument is your artifact making?
* **Plan**: What is the *detailed* plan for creating this artifact in support of your argument? Which technologies will you use? How will you share/create/access different assets you will need? What are the specific and detailed tasks you will need to complete to build your artifact?
* **Justification**: Why is your proposed design the most effective way of making this argument?
* **Collaboration Plan**: Who in your group will be responsible for each task?
* **Timeline**: When will each element of the artifact identified in the **Plan** be completed?
	* Make sure to include the [**Mockup**](#mockup) and the [**Group Work Report**](#group-work-report) in your timeline.

This proposal can take any form you want, though I will need an artifact. If you are most comfortable writing stuff, you can create a standard technical report. If you would prefer to try your hand at a pitch presentation, you can pitch it in class or to me in my office hours, or submit it as a narrated PowerPoint presentation (though we would need to chat on [Slack](https://engl460.slack.com) afterwards).

#### Group Contract (optional)

If you would like to set standards of accountability for your group members, please draw up a contract that will outline specific consequences for what happens if deadlines are not met, meetings are missed, or items in the plan are not completed. Draft this contract as you see fit and include it in the **Proposal** and I will provide feedback and suggest revisions before the contract becomes binding.

If you choose to complete a group contract, we (your group and I) will be bound by its contents.

#### Mockup

After your proposal has been approved by me (and been evaluated by your peers, if you like), your group can start building a mockup. This can be at any level of sophistication you want and must conform to what you are proposing to build.

For instance, if you are making something using [Twine](https://twinery.org), your mockup could be a collection of note cards that map out the space of your story. If you are making a website, you might create a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) or a series of rough drawings to outline how the site will work. If you are creating a video, you might create a [storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard). How you do this is up to you, but the mockup needs to give some sense of how the finished product will work.

#### Artifact

This is the central focus of the project. You will need to create the artifact you described in your proposal and have demoed via your mock-up.

Plan to do a demonstration of your project during the final two weeks of class. In this presentation, you outline your argument, show us your project, discuss the process of creating the artifact, reflect on how you would do the project differently, and 

#### Group Work Report

How did everything go? Write me a roughly one page reflection on:

1. How you worked as a collaborator
1. How your team members worked as collaborators
1. What you did that worked
1. What you did that did not work

This document will be individually authored by each team member and will help me evaluate everyone's projects for the final course grade.
